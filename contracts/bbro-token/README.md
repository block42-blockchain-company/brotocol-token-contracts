# bBRO Token

This folder implements a modified [CW-20 token standard](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/tree/main/contracts/cw20-base), which is the basis for the `$bBro` token.

The differences to a typical CW-20 token is that it's non-transferable. 

A wallet can only hold the token, and redeem it in the brokkr brotocol ecosystem. It can't be send to other wallets or contracts.
